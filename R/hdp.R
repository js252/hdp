#' Cancer mutation count data
#'
#' Mutation count data from SomaticCancerAlterations package.

#' Posterior sampling chain with cancer mutation data
#'
#' HDP posterior sampling chain with data from SomaticCancerAlterations package.
#' Categories are the 96 base substitution types defined by local trinucleotide

#' Chain initialised with 10 clusters, then run through 4000 burn-in iterations
#' before collecting 50 posterior samples with 50 iterations between each.

#' cancer types: lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and melanoma.
#' Categories are the 96 base substitution types defined by local trinucleotide
#' content.
#' Nodes 2:304 are frozen (old data from other cancer types),
#' node 305 is the parent node for the LUSC samples,
#' and nodes 306:405 hold the data for the 100 new LUSC samples.
