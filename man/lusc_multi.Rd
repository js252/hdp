\format{A hdpSampleMulti object with 200 posterior samples, 50 from each chain}
\usage{
lusc_multi
}
\description{
Four independent HDP sampling chains for lung squamous cell carcinoma
data, conditioned on previous HDP output (mut_example_multi) for three other
cancer types: lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and melanoma.
Categories are the 96 base substitution types defined by local trinucleotide
content.
Nodes 2:304 are frozen (old data from other cancer types),
node 305 is the parent node for the LUSC samples,
and nodes 306:405 hold the data for the 100 new LUSC samples.
